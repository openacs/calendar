      I took over calendar package maintainership in May 2003 and am currently
      moving html generation into the adp pages. Calendar is currently
      <strong>not</strong> recommended for production use. Here's the wish
      list of things - in no particular order:

      <ul>
      <li>Proper I18N:
        <ul>
        <li>Choose when a week starts
        <li>Day and month names
        <li>Time and date format
        </ul>
      <li>Notifications
      <li>Reminders
      <li>Multi-day events
      <li>iCal format compatible. Ideally, import/export to
      Outlook/iCalendar/etc.. via iCal format (by Jade)
      <li>Ability to map any sort of date information in a database to the
      calendar, this means tickets, bugs, etc. perhaps via a service contract
      (by Jade)

      <li>There should be any easy UI for specifying what is shown. Both the
      user and the admin should be able to select these things (the admin sets
      the range of what is possible, the user can select from those choices)
      (by Jade)

      <li>Events should be able to span more than a day. Ideally, the UI for
      this should look good. (by Jade)

      <li>An ability to be able to add data via the calendar as well. Anything
      that implements the service contract should allow you +to add
      information on that date as well. For example, add a ticket due that
      day, or add an event for that day, etc.. (by Jade)

      <li>The calendar needs to be printable (at least for where I work)


      </ul>

      <p>This is old stuff and will probably disappear in the near
      future. (June-2003)
