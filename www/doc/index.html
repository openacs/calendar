      I took over calendar package maintainership in May 2003 and am currently
      moving html generation into the adp pages. CVS head's Calendar is
      currently <strong>not</strong> ready for production use, revert to the
      "before-noquote" version if you need to have calendar up and running
      now. 

      <p>Here's the wish list of things - in no particular order:

      <ul>
      <li>Proper I18N:
        <ul>
        <li>Choose when a week starts
        <li>Day and month names
        <li>Time and date format
        </ul>
      <li>Notifications
      <li>Reminders
      <li>Multi-day events
      <li>iCal format compatible. Ideally, import/export to
      Outlook/iCalendar/etc.. via iCal format (by Jade)
      <li>Ability to map any sort of date information in a database to the
      calendar, this means tickets, bugs, etc. perhaps via a service contract
      (by Jade)

      <li>There should be any easy UI for specifying what is shown. Both the
      user and the admin should be able to select these things (the admin sets
      the range of what is possible, the user can select from those choices)
      (by Jade)

      <li>Events should be able to span more than a day. Ideally, the UI for
      this should look good. (by Jade)

      <li>An ability to be able to add data via the calendar as well. Anything
      that implements the service contract should allow you +to add
      information on that date as well. For example, add a ticket due that
      day, or add an event for that day, etc.. (by Jade)

      <li>The calendar needs to be printable (at least for where I work)

      </ul>

      <p>
      Data Model suggestions.

      <p>
      Don:<br>
Calendar items should map arbitrary objects (perhaps only content items) to a 
given calendar and given acs-events.  We shouldn't have to derive special 
types from cal item type in order to attach it to a calendar (nor should we 
have to duplicate content to attach it to two calendars as we do now)

If we restricted the mapping to content items (i.e. calendar info some sort of 
content type) we could use the CR's ability to map a template to a given 
content type or item to make it possible for the calendar package to display 
calendar item details using that facility, giving the package adding 
something to the calendar control over how it is displayed.  Much more 
general.
    

    <p>Thanks to 
    <ul>
    <li>Raad Al-Rawi from Cambridge University for calendar.css and all of the
    layout.
    </ul>


      <p>This is old stuff and will probably disappear in the near
      future. (June-2003)
